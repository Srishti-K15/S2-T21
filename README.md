## Abstract

  <summary>Detail</summary>
   
   ### Motivation
The project is motivated by the critical need to have evacuation systems that
are smart, adaptable, and help save lives in emergencies; the complexity and overpopulation
of urban areas today call for allowing escape routes to be optimized even in unpredictable
conditions through efficient algorithms like Dijkstra’s. It can be incorporated into emergency
response systems to greatly increase the safety and efficiency of evacuations in life-threatening
situations such as fires. In emergencies such as building fires, time is rather critical. Finding the
safest and fastest route to evacuate, can be lifesaving. Conventional fire evacuation approaches
rely on static plans that may not be useful during real situations. Such hostile environments
require intelligent systems that must travel by the safest path possible and take into account
the continuously changing conditions generated by the fire.
  
  ### Problem Statement: 
  In the case of a fire outbreak inside a building, finding the safest and
quickest evacuation route for a person is critical. Given the building’s layout, the person must
navigate through hallways and rooms to reach an exit point while avoiding areas affected by
fire. We have developed a solution using Dijkstra’s algorithm to determine the shortest and
safest path from the person’s current location (source node) to the nearest exit (destination
node).
  
  ### Features:
 • This project aims to implement Dijkstra’s Algorithm practically by physically constructing
it using Verilog and modern circuit components [Galles, ].<br>
• It introduces a hardware approach to pathfinding, moving beyond theoretical concepts
[YouTube, ].<br>
• Unlike software-based implementations, this design utilizes parallelism to achieve higher
speed and efficiency in finding the shortest paths [GeeksforGeeks, ].<br>
• Logisim is used to draw and simulate circuits, making it possible to understand how the
algorithm works in hardware [Galles, ].<br>
• The project helps appreciate the management of resources and the complexity of the
circuits involved [GeeksforGeeks, ].

  ### EQUATIONS

  
### 1. Initialization Equations
Before the algorithm begins, several variables and arrays are initialised.<br>
Verilog Representation:<br>
for (i = 0; i < 9; i = i + 1) begin<br>
dist[i] = (i == source) ? 8’h00 : 8’hFF;<br>
end<br>
### Parent Initialization
Each node’s parent is initially set to an invalid value, indicating that no paths have been<br>
established yet.<br>
Verilog Representation:<br>
for (i = 0; i < 9; i = i + 1) begin<br>
parent[i] = 4’hF; // INVALID<br>
end<br>
### Visited Array Initialization
All nodes are marked as unvisited at the start.<br>
Verilog Representation:<br>
visited = 9’b000000000;<br>
### 2. Adjusting the Adjacency Matrix Based on subset cells<br>
The adjacency matrix defines the connectivity between nodes in the grid. The subset cells input<br>
determines which cells (nodes) are included or blocked. If a cell is blocked (i.e., subset cells[i]<br>
= 0), all its connections are removed by setting the corresponding adjacency bits to 0.<br>
Verilog Representation:<br>
for (i = 0; i < 9; i = i + 1) begin<br>
if (!subset cells[i]) begin<br>
adj matrix[i] = 9’b000000000;<br>
end<br>
end<br>
### 3. Main Loop:Dijkstra’s Algorithm Operations
The core of Dijkstra’s algorithm involves iteratively selecting the unvisited node with the<br>
smallest tentative distance, updating the distances of its neighbors, and marking it as visited.<br>
This process continues until the destination is reached or no more nodes can be selected.<br>
### A. Selecting the Current Node with Minimum Distance
At each iteration, select the unvisited node with the smallest tentative distance.If no such node<br>
exists (i.e., all remaining nodes are unreachable), the algorithm terminates.<br>
Verilog Representation:<br>
min dist = 8’hFF; // Initialize to infinity<br>
next node = 4’hF; // INVALID<br>
for (j = 0; j < 9; j = j + 1) begin<br>
if (!visited[j] & (dist[j] ¡]< min dist)) begin<br>
min dist = dist[j];<br>
next node = j;<br>
end<br>
end<br>
if (next node == 4’hF) begin<br>
// No more nodes to process<br>
break;<br>
end else begin<br>
current node = next node;<br>
end<br>
### B. Marking the Current Node as Visited
Once a node uu is selected, mark it as visited to prevent reprocessing.<br>
Verilog Representation:<br>
visited[current node] = 1’b1;<br>
### C. Updating Distances of Neighboring Nodes
For each neighbour of the current node, update the tentative distance if a shorter path is<br>
found.<br>
Verilog Representation:<br>
for (j = 0; j < 9; j = j + 1) begin<br>
if (adj matrix[current node][j] & !visited[j]) begin<br>
if (dist[current node] + 8’h01 < dist[j]) begin<br>
dist[j] = dist[current node] + 8’h01;<br>
parent[j] = current node;<br>
end<br>
end<br>
end<br>
### D. Iterative Loop Control
Repeat the selection and updating steps until the destination is reached or no more nodes can<br>
be processed.<br>
Verilog Representation:<br>
for (i = 0; i < 9; i = i + 1) begin<br>
// Selection, marking, and updating steps as described above<br>
// Break the loop if no next node is found<br>
end<br>
### 4. Path Reconstruction Equations
After completing the main loop, if the destination node has been reached (i.e., dist[destination]<br>
is not infinity), reconstruct the shortest path by tracing back from the destination to the source<br>
using the parent array.<br>
### A. Determining Shortest Distance
shortest distance=dist[destination]<br>
Verilog Representation:<br>
shortest distance = dist[destination];<br>
### B. Reconstructing the Path
Initialize path out to zero and iteratively set the bits corresponding to each node in the path<br>
from the destination back to the source.<br>
Verilog Representation:<br>
path out = 9’b000000000;<br>
current node = destination;<br>
for (j = 0; current node != source & j < 9 & current node != 4’hF; j = j + 1) begin<br>
path out = path out — (1 !! current node);<br>
current node = parent[current node];<br>
end<br>
path out = path out — (1 !! source);<br>
### C. Handling No Path Found
If the destination remains unreachable after the main loop, indicate that no valid path exists.<br>
Verilog Representation:<br>
if (dist[destination] != 8’hFF) begin<br>
// Reconstruct path as shown above<br>
end else begin<br>
path out = 9’b000000000;<br>
end<br>
