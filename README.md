## Abstract

   ### Motivation
The project is motivated by the critical need to have evacuation systems that
are smart, adaptable, and help save lives in emergencies; the complexity and overpopulation
of urban areas today call for allowing escape routes to be optimized even in unpredictable
conditions through efficient algorithms like Dijkstra’s. It can be incorporated into emergency
response systems to greatly increase the safety and efficiency of evacuations in life-threatening
situations such as fires. In emergencies such as building fires, time is rather critical. Finding the
safest and fastest route to evacuate, can be lifesaving. Conventional fire evacuation approaches
rely on static plans that may not be useful during real situations. Such hostile environments
require intelligent systems that must travel by the safest path possible and take into account
the continuously changing conditions generated by the fire.
  
  ### Problem Statement: 
  In the case of a fire outbreak inside a building, finding the safest and
quickest evacuation route for a person is critical. Given the building’s layout, the person must
navigate through hallways and rooms to reach an exit point while avoiding areas affected by
fire. We have developed a solution using Dijkstra’s algorithm to determine the shortest and
safest path from the person’s current location (source node) to the nearest exit (destination
node).
  
  ### Features:
 • This project aims to implement Dijkstra’s Algorithm practically by physically constructing
it using Verilog and modern circuit components [Galles, ].<br>
• It introduces a hardware approach to pathfinding, moving beyond theoretical concepts
[YouTube, ].<br>
• Unlike software-based implementations, this design utilizes parallelism to achieve higher
speed and efficiency in finding the shortest paths [GeeksforGeeks, ].<br>
• Logisim is used to draw and simulate circuits, making it possible to understand how the
algorithm works in hardware [Galles, ].<br>
• The project helps appreciate the management of resources and the complexity of the
circuits involved [GeeksforGeeks, ].

•	This project aims to find the shortest path between two points in a 3x3 grid, where some paths may be blocked or unreachable due to fire or obstacles. We represent the grid using an adjacency matrix that tracks the connections between nodes (cells). The algorithm must adjust dynamically for blocked cells and then compute the shortest path from a given source node to a destination node.</br>
•	If a valid path exists, the output will be the path and its total distance. If no path is found, the algorithm will indicate that the destination is unreachable. This ensures that the algorithm provides a clear result based on the state of the grid.</br>
•	To solve this, we use Dijkstra’s algorithm, a well-known method for finding the shortest path between nodes in a graph. The algorithm works by iteratively selecting the unvisited node with the smallest tentative distance from the source. Once the node is selected, its neighboring nodes are updated, and the node is marked as visited.</br>
•	This process continues until the algorithm has either visited all reachable nodes or found the shortest path to the destination. The key idea is that once a node’s shortest path is determined, it no longer needs to be revisited, which ensures that the algorithm runs efficiently.</br>
•	The grid’s nodes are represented by an adjacency matrix, which indicates which nodes are connected. However, some nodes might be blocked or unreachable due to obstacles, such as fire. Before running the algorithm, we adjust this matrix by removing connections to and from blocked nodes.</br>
•	By doing so, the algorithm will no longer attempt to use these blocked paths. This step ensures that only valid paths are considered, improving the accuracy of the shortest path search.</br>
•	The core of Dijkstra’s algorithm involves progressively finding the shortest path to each node. In each iteration, the unvisited node with the smallest known distance from the source is selected. This node becomes the current node, and it is marked as visited to avoid being processed again.</br>
•	Next, the algorithm checks each of the current node’s neighboring nodes to see if a shorter path can be found through the current node. If a shorter path is discovered, the distance is updated, and the current node becomes the parent of the neighbor. This process repeats until either the destination node is reached or all reachable nodes are visited.</br>
•	After the algorithm completes, we check whether the destination node was reached. If the distance to the destination is not infinity, it means a valid path was found. To reconstruct the path, we trace back through the parent nodes from the destination to the source, revealing the shortest route step-by-step.</br>
•	If the distance to the destination remains at infinity, it means no valid path exists, and we return a result indicating that the destination is unreachable. This final step not only provides the shortest distance but also the exact path taken, making the output clear and informative.
