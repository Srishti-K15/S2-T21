   ### Motivation
The project is motivated by the critical need to have evacuation systems that
are smart, adaptable, and help save lives in emergencies; the complexity and overpopulation
of urban areas today call for allowing escape routes to be optimized even in unpredictable
conditions through efficient algorithms like Dijkstra’s. It can be incorporated into emergency
response systems to greatly increase the safety and efficiency of evacuations in life-threatening
situations such as fires. In emergencies such as building fires, time is rather critical. Finding the
safest and fastest route to evacuate, can be lifesaving. Conventional fire evacuation approaches
rely on static plans that may not be useful during real situations. Such hostile environments
require intelligent systems that must travel by the safest path possible and take into account
the continuously changing conditions generated by the fire.
  
  ### Problem Statement: 
  In the case of a fire outbreak inside a building, finding the safest and
quickest evacuation route for a person is critical. Given the building’s layout, the person must
navigate through hallways and rooms to reach an exit point while avoiding areas affected by
fire. We have developed a solution using Dijkstra’s algorithm to determine the shortest and
safest path from the person’s current location (source node) to the nearest exit (destination
node).
  
  ### Features:
 • This project aims to implement Dijkstra’s Algorithm practically by physically constructing
it using Verilog and modern circuit components [Galles, ].<br>
• It introduces a hardware approach to pathfinding, moving beyond theoretical concepts
[YouTube, ].<br>
• Unlike software-based implementations, this design utilizes parallelism to achieve higher
speed and efficiency in finding the shortest paths [GeeksforGeeks, ].<br>
• Logisim is used to draw and simulate circuits, making it possible to understand how the
algorithm works in hardware [Galles, ].<br>
• The project helps appreciate the management of resources and the complexity of the
circuits involved [GeeksforGeeks, ].
